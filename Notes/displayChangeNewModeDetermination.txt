Is this really the best way to determine if the transaction is in display mode versus create/change? 
IF SY-TCODE = 'VA03'.

The beverage module has some code that looks like this:
CASE SCREEN-GROUP1.
WHEN 'JU1'. "Felder 'Container erzeugen? Ja'
IF T180-TRTYP = CHARA OR "Anzeigen
T180-TRTYP = CHARH. "Anlegen
"Felder 'Container erzeugen? Ja' erscheinen:
SCREEN-ACTIVE = 0.
ELSE. "trtyp = 'V' bedeutet Ã„ndern
SCREEN-ACTIVE = 1.
ENDIF.
ENDCASE.

I think we are supposed to use the T180-TRTYP = 'A' to indicate display mode.  I was searching for this when I found your wiki.  The wiki is really helpful and well organized.  Just wondering if anyone has opinions on the use of T180-TRTYP?

These are the possible values:
 


* Masked
A Display
B Edit
C Display from archive
E Single-item planning
H Add
V Change
X Initial transaction
S Standard parameter: normal mode
U Convert indiv. planned order
L Delete
